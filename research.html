      <h3>Study Group Finder</h3>
      <h4>2014.10-2014.12</h4>
      <p class="text_justify">
        In the HCI course project, we built a group finder system.
        I worked with Haiyu Yao, Yihuan Dong and Nakul Shukla on this system.
      </p>
      <p class="text_justify">
        NCSU Group Finder is an interactive web-based service designed to facilitate creation of study groups in the library.
        Group Finder was implemented by closely following common human-computer interaction (HCI) principles.
        NCSU Group Finder improves upon existing system like GroupFinder(D.H. Hill library) by
        increasing the convenience with which users can find and/or create groups, arrange meetings,
        manage groups and perform other related tasks.
      </p>
      <p class="text_justify">
        The system is developed by ASP.NET MVC 5, SQL Server, JQuery and Bootstrap. In our team,
        I focused on the frontend design of the system.

      <h3>3D Face Reconstruction Based on a Single Image</h3>
      <h4>2013.09-2014.06</h4>
      <p class="text_justify">
        I worked as a research assistant in the State Key Laboratory at Chinese Academy of Sciences,
        working with
        <a href="http://www.sigvc.org/why/">Dr. Huaiyu Wu</a>
        on the 3D human face reconstruction project.
      </p>
      <p class="text_justify">
        In this project, I assisted with the development of 3D faces reconstruction based on a morphable model using Matlab.
        In the system, the 3D human face can be built from a single 2D image. I use the
        <a href="http://www.faceplusplus.com">
          <span>FACE++</span>
        </a> API to get the human face landmark
        automatically. So the whole reconstructing process can be done automatically.
         The average reconstructing time is 7s.
      </p>
      <p class="text_justify">
        The interface is built by Matlab, the 3D face reconstruction process picture on the interface is from
        <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=311556">
          <span>Volker Blanz and Thomas Vetter's paper.</span>
        </a>
        The example 2D human face image is from
        <a href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~aam/">
          <span>Active Appearance Models.</span>

      <h4>2013.03-2013.07</h4>
      <p class="text_justify">
        In the Compiler course project, we built a tiny C compiler using JAVA. I implemented
        a Lexical Analyser by converting the regular
        expressions to minimized Deterministic finite automation(DFA)
        and a Syntax Analyser for LL(1) and LR(0) grammar.

      <h4>2013.03-2013.06</h4>
      <p class="text_justify">
        In the Artificial Intelligence course project, we built simple digital number recognition system.
        This system is based on Artificial Neural Network.
        I built a predictor based on a 3-layer feed-forward neural network
        using the resilient backpropagation algorithm.

      <h3>Personalized Information Service Based on Web Data Extraction and Analysis</h3>
      <h4>2012.04-2013.04</h4>
      <p class="text_justify">
        In this research project, we built a web-based system which helps user extract the data on a website.
        I worked with Dr.Junxia Guo on this system.
      </p>
      <p class="text_justify">
        In this project, I researched algorithms such as
         Breadth-first and Best-first to get the best order to access URL.
          I wrote programs to collect web data extracted by the page
          path and preserved them in different file formats according to personalization.
